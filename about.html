    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <h3>Krissia</h3>
    <p>I recently turned 18, as you can probably already see my favorite show is Attack on titan and my favorite character is Eren Yeager. The show has a lot of sentimental value to me because i started watching it when i was in second grade, At the time i had a family member in the hospital so everyday I would sit there and watch this next to their bed, the show is still ongoing and it became such a big part of my life since then.</p>
